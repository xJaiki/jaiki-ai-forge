    prompt: `Create a Kinetic Typography Landscape landing page for Jaiki, a full-stack developer specializing in React and Node.js. 
      The page should feature a full-screen typographic experience where text itself becomes the interface.

      Color palette:
      - Background: #0A0E17 (deep space black)
      - Primary text: #E2E8F0 (off-white)
      - Accent colors: #00FFAA (neon green), #FF3366 (hot pink), #3A86FF (electric blue)

      Typography:
      - Code elements: JetBrains Mono
      - Headings: Space Grotesk (extra bold)
      - Body text: Inter (light)

      Layout:
      - The main headline "JAIKI.DEV" should dominate the center screen initially at 15rem size, floating in 3D space.
      - Large typography elements form an interactive landscape that users can navigate.

      Components:
      1. Hero section: Featuring Jaiki's name and title with floating code snippets that respond to mouse movement using 3D transforms.
      2. About section: Biography text that assembles letter by letter as if being typed in real-time.
      3. Skills section: Programming languages and technologies represented as terminal commands that expand to show proficiency levels when clicked.
      4. Projects section: Project cards that appear to be floating in space, with glitch effects on hover.
      5. Contact section: Form fields that emerge from a command line interface.

      Interactions:
      - Text elements should subtly float and rotate based on cursor position using mouse parallax effects.
      - Navigation should work through clickable "command" text that triggers dramatic text transformation animations between sections.
      - Implement a terminal-like experience where users can "type" commands to navigate (with auto-complete suggestions).

      Animations:
      - Text should have subtle constant movement, simulating floating in space.
      - Transitions between sections should involve text disassembling and reassembling.
      - Implement glitch effects on key interactions using CSS animations.
      - Use GSAP for smooth animation sequencing.

      The landing page should position Jaiki as an innovative full-stack developer with 5 years of experience, 
      specializing in building high-performance web applications.`,

      - Highlight color: #FF3300 (bright red for annotations and focus states)
      - Text: #000000 (black)

      Typography:
      - UI annotations: JetBrains Mono (light)
      - Headings: IBM Plex Sans (extra bold) with visible baseline guides
      - Body text: Inter (regular) with character spacing measurements
      - All text should include at least one visible typographic measurement

      Components:
      1. Hero blueprint: A header area with Jaiki's name and title, showing visible measurement lines and grid coordinates
      2. Component library: A section displaying Jaiki's skills as a collection of UI components in various states of construction
      3. Project wireframes: Portfolio items presented as annotated wireframes with functional hotspots
      4. Process flowchart: A visual representation of Jaiki's development methodology shown as a system diagram
      5. Contact interface: A form with visible input boundaries, validation zones, and interaction states

      Interactions:
      - Elements should reveal their structure and boundaries on hover
      - Include "inspection mode" toggles that show additional information about components
      - Design navigation that displays the full site map in an abstract representation
      - Add interactive elements that show their possible states simultaneously
      - Implement form elements that display their validation parameters

      Animations:
      - Components should assemble from wireframe to complete state when entering the viewport
      - Use animations that reveal measurement guidelines before completing
      - Transitions between sections should show restructuring of the layout grid
      - Include animated annotations that measure or mark up elements
      - Add blueprint-style drawing animations for decorative elements

        - Font sizes and weights should correspond to sonic depth and intensity
  
        Components:
        1. Hero section: Interactive typography that responds to cursor movement with audio modulation.
        2. Portfolio gallery: Each thumbnail emits a unique sound as users hover, with animations synchronized to sound waves.
        3. About section: Text appearing in rhythmic sequences with corresponding melodic phrasing.
        4. Interactive sound map: Users can explore different UI elements by creating harmonious sound compositions.
        5. Contact interface: Form fields generate soft tonal cues as users input information.
  
        Interactions:
        - Clicking on elements should produce both a visual and audio reaction.
        - Navigation uses both sound cues and visual indicators to guide the user.
        - Users can create dynamic sound paths through different sections.
  
        Animations:
        - Transitions follow musical phrasing rather than standard mechanical animations.
        - Sound-reactive elements subtly shift and modulate based on user interaction.
        - Background visuals may oscillate or pulse in response to ambient audio layers.
  
        The landing page should feel like an immersive synesthetic experience, making the userâ€™s journey a fluid interplay of visuals and sound.`,

        2. Dimension Controller: An interactive element that lets users shift focus between realities
        3. Reality Blender: A system for combining elements from multiple streams
        4. Interdimensional Links: Connections that highlight related content across realities
        5. Reality Map: A meta-navigation showing the multidimensional structure
  
        Interactions:
        - Implement smooth "reality shifting" that changes focus between streams
        - Create "element pulling" where users can drag content from one reality to another
        - Design "reality merging" that combines compatible streams into hybrid views
        - Develop "focus locking" that temporarily maximizes one reality while keeping others accessible
        - Add "reality scrubbing" where users can slide between different dimensional states
        - Include "reality bookmarking" to save specific multidimensional configurations
  
        Animations:
        - Smooth transitions as focus shifts between reality streams
        - Scale, opacity, and saturation changes to indicate dimensional prominence
        - Fluid animations when elements cross between realities
        - Particle effects or energy trails to visualize dimensional boundaries
        - Subtle ambient movements within each reality to give them a sense of life
  
        Special features:
        - Each reality should contain complete but different information about Jaiki
        - The system should suggest cross-dimensional connections based on current focus
        - Implement a "reality collapse" option that provides a more traditional view for accessibility
        - Create "dimensional echoes" where certain important elements appear across multiple realities
  
        The landing page should position Jaiki as a developer fascinated by multimodal experiences and parallel processing, 
        highlighting his work in creating interfaces that break free from linear navigation and allow users to explore multiple content dimensions simultaneously.`,
