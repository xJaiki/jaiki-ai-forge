# Jaiki AI Forge

A showcase of AI-generated React Tailwind designs, created entirely by Claude 3.7 Sonnet using [Jaiki React Template Minimal](https://github.com/xjaiki/react-template-minimal)

## About

Jaiki AI Forge is a catalog of web design styles completely generated by AI. Every component, from the style concepts to the React code implementation, was created by Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking mode enabled.

The only human contribution was integration, organization, and this documentation.

## Features

- **100% AI-Generated Designs**: All design concepts and code created by Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- **Multiple Design Styles**: Explore various design approaches including Kinetic Typography, Wireframe Deconstruction, Sensory Synesthesia, and more
- **Raw AI Output**: Visual glitches and inconsistencies are preserved as part of the authentic AI-generated experience
- **Prompt Showcase**: View the original prompts that generated each design

## Technology Stack

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet (AI)

## Philosophy

This project showcases the raw creative capabilities of AI in web design. Rather than polishing the output, I've preserved the unfiltered AI-generated code to document the current state of AI design capabilities, including its quirks and limitations.

## Usage

Browse through the different styles to see what's possible with AI-generated design. Each style includes the original prompt used to generate it, allowing you to understand the relationship between text instructions and visual output.

## Contributing

This project is meant to be an AI showcase, but feel free to fork it and experiment with your own AI-generated designs.
